## Stephanie Stone
### Technical Writer | User Advocate | Chaos Wrangler

**I deliver effective content solutions for clients and end-users through clear communication.** <br>

Recent projects include:
- How-to guides and help content
- Style guides for user experience (UX)
- Knowledge base revision and expansion
- User research and content analytics

If you have scattered and outdated content that needs wrangling, I'm that rare person who thrives on the tedium required to create order and beauty out of chaos. If your product doesn't offer help content for end-users, I can build a comprehensive user guide from scratch.
